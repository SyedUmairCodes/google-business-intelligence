# Explore business intelligence careers
We often hear about all of the data that's created each and every day. It could be something as simple as taking a photo with your phone or paying your bills, or something as complex as a global company launching a new product or running a multimedia advertising campaign. It really feels like practically everything creates data. So it's no wonder that organizations need experts to help them access the right data, use it to find ways to grow and improve, and put those insights into action. In fact, as the volume of data is ever escalating so is a need for professionals who can make that data shine. For instance, in my role, I'm proud to be able to use data to give my stakeholders a quick overview of exactly what they need to know without getting lost in the details. The tools I create enable them to clearly evaluate the candidate hiring and employee experiences within Google's People Operations. One way this works is by showing my stakeholders how long the interview journey is when someone is being hired at Google. This is important because it helps them determine if we need to hire more recruiters or interview schedulers in order to improve the process for our candidates. In this video, you'll learn more about how those of us in BI offer value to our colleagues and how we help shape the future of our organizations. There are so many different potential roles to explore. For example, in this program, you'll learn a lot about BI analysts and BI engineers. BI analysts gather requirements from stakeholders, partners, and team members. They use their understanding of large datasets to retrieve, organize, and interpret data. Then they create visualizations, dashboards, and reports to use when presenting and communicating insights to others. The intelligence they share might be used to make decisions, develop a new process, or create a business strategy, or it could be applied to even deeper analysis. BI engineers are responsible for designing, configuring, implementing, and improving data tools and processes. They evaluate and streamline various devices, infrastructures, and information channels called pipelines. Engineers are excellent troubleshooters and help find solutions to security issues, application permissions and updates, and other technical challenges. In other words, a BI engineer manages tools and processes, which enables a BI analyst to put those tools and processes to work. However, it's also important to note that some companies don't distinguish between those two BI jobs, using the terms analyst and engineer interchangeably. So when you begin to explore job opportunities, be sure to spend some time researching the job and organization in order to fully understand what's involved. No matter which path you ultimately choose, a career in BI has a potential to be amazing. Research shows that all industries today need skilled BI professionals. But there are not enough people with the right experience and talent to satisfy this demand. BI professionals enjoy strong career prospects. In fact, a quick search for job openings in the industry reveals thousands of opportunities on LinkedIn alone. But perhaps best of all, BI professionals find the work rewarding and fulfilling because we know what we do makes someone else's life better. Coming up and throughout this program, you'll discover some really inspiring examples of just how BI makes such a positive impact. I can't wait to share them with you. just how BI makes such a positive impact.

# Business intelligence drives change
As you have been learning, a business’s ability to identify issues before they become problems or act on opportunities before their competition is key to intelligent decision-making. Now more than ever, we have access to data about our marketplace, organizations, customers, competitors, and employees. But in order to turn that data into rapid results, we need business intelligence. Business intelligence involves automating processes and information channels in order to transform relevant data into actionable insights that are easily available to decision-makers.

## Example One
Consider a fictitious scenario about a fast-food restaurant chain. Leaders at this company have huge amounts of data to manage, such as:

customer transactions

marketing data related to promotions

customer satisfaction

employee information

And so much more! But on top of all of that, the company also has to consider the logistics for individual restaurants. That’s where the problem comes in.

The problem
The restaurants need to have ingredients to cook and serve customers, but if they have too much, that extra stock often goes to waste. Company leadership consults with their BI team to consider how to approach two concerns:

How to ensure the restaurants’ numerous locations have enough ingredients to meet customer demand

How to reduce food waste

However, these stakeholders currently don’t have metrics in place to specifically measure food waste or strategies to reduce it. This is exactly where the BI team will need to start.

The solution
In order to address the stakeholder’s needs, the BI team spends time gathering information about current metrics and processes. They first use this information to determine what data they have and how it’s being used. They discover that there are already useful metrics being applied in other ways by various teams in the company, including:

How many ingredients are delivered to each location

How much of each menu item is made each day

How much of each menu item is actually being ordered each day

By comparing these existing metrics, the company can better understand how much food is going to waste. Thus, the BI analysts are able to gather the necessary information on incoming food delivery, customer orders, and food consumption in the form of a dashboard for stakeholders to monitor food waste. The BI analysts then organize this data within the database systems and deliver it to new tables that report the results for stakeholders to consider as they strategize how to reduce food waste.

The results
Knowing how much food is actually going to waste now enables stakeholders to better achieve their goals. The restaurant chain discovers that the largest source of food waste is the French fries. Across their locations, 10–20% of French fries are left over at the end of the month. With this information, the company’s central operations team sends out a memo to all branches recommending they reduce their incoming French fry delivery by 10%. In this way, the BI analysts are able to help the business identify an area for improvement and reduce waste.

## Example two
Hospitals also have to manage a lot of different kinds of data — especially patient information. They also have a variety of data sources that they need to access and share to ensure that other connected users — such as doctors working outside of the hospital — can get patients the treatment they need without wasting time or resources.

The problem
For this scenario, consider a hospital system that’s challenged to communicate effectively with doctors who don’t work within the same hospital system. Administrators have noticed that this creates a few different problems:

Doctors outside of the system can’t access test results from the hospital

Patients are being tested multiple times

This is expensive and inefficient, both for the hospital and patients. So, decision-makers choose to work with a team of BI specialists to create database systems that get data in the hands of doctors who need it.

The solution
Basically, this hospital system is experiencing a problem related to inaccessible patient data. There is a lot of data streaming in from multiple source systems that needs to be consolidated into one destination that can be used by doctors, including information about:

Previous visits

Tests

Allergies

And other relevant medical information. So, the BI team develops a pipeline system that ingests data from all key sources, processes and transforms it so that it is consistent, and delivers it to a database system where doctors are able to access all the information they need.

The results
By streamlining the hospital’s many data sources into one consolidated database, the BI team helps save the hospital money and resources by eliminating duplicate tests. Now, doctors are better able to treat patients, patients save money on redundant tests and procedures, and the hospital can run more efficiently. This is all thanks to the tools built by the BI team!

# Business intelligence teams and partners

What do you do when you're facing a really challenging task or big problem? You've done your research, tried multiple approaches, but nothing seems to be working. It's natural to be frustrated. We've all been there. But a much better strategy is to simply ask for help. As the saying goes, two heads are better than one. And in business complex problems often require 5, 10, or even hundreds of people coming up with potential solutions. This is why business intelligence professionals collaborate with lots of different team members in their work. Brainstorming and building together, pulling knowledge, and working out issues is essential to the BI process. BI professionals also rely on team members to provide important inputs for their projects and to partner on solutions. This video will share examples of the key players you might work with. Keep in mind every organization handles job titles differently, so you may encounter some discrepancies or overlap, but this is a great place to start. First up, API professionals. API stands for application programming interface. This is a set of functions and procedures that integrate computer programs forming a connection that enables them to communicate. There are so many different roles that involve APIs. Including API strategists, developer, engineer, and product owner. When you're working in business intelligence, you might collaborate with API professionals in order to create the interface that you need for a particular project, especially if some of your data is coming from a third party platform. APIs bring that data into the internal company database in order to build reporting tools and dashboards. API professionals code in a number of different computing languages including Python, Java, and so many others. So it's up to API partners to write code that's specific to each project and business need. You may work with data warehousing specialists who develop processes and procedures to effectively store and organize data. These people also help ensure BI professionals can easily access the data they need. There are also data governance professionals. These team members are responsible for the formal management of an organization's data assets. This may involve managing the availability, integrity, and security of data based on internal standards and policies. This is very important for making sure data is trustworthy and doesn't get misused or corrupted. Of course data analysts are key partners as they collect, transform and organize data. They are dataset specialists reviewing and validating the data all the time. They also identify and implement exciting new analysis methodologies. Another key team is IT. Information technology professionals test install, repair, upgrade, and maintain the hardware and software solutions that organizations use every single day. BI professionals work with the IT department in order to maximize all of the available data and data tools. In addition, project managers are key collaborators, as they handle the day-to-day project steps, scope, schedule, budget, resources, and much more. There are all kinds of contributors and every organization is different. Who you work with will depend on the size of the company, the available tools, and the nature of the work. For example, if your project deals with the customer experience, then the customer success team will be essential to providing inputs. If your project is about employee engagement, then you'll work closely with the HR team. And because my work involves hiring processes, I really benefit from collaborating with the recruiting team members here at Google. Now, there is another essential group of people on the team and that's your stakeholders. In an upcoming section in this course, we'll talk lots more about the various stakeholder roles as they relate to BI. We'll also explore different stakeholder goals and how you can use your BI skills to reach them. Stay tuned.

# Collaboration with business intelligence partners
Previously, you learned about the many different partners a business intelligence professional might team up with to create systems and tools for an organization to improve processes and provide stakeholders with ongoing insights. These partners could include:

API professionals

Data warehousing specialists

Data governance professionals

Data analysts

IT professionals

Project managers

And many more!

Complex business problems require collaboration and cross-team cooperation. These partners have unique knowledge, experience, skills, and perspectives to bring to the table. Brainstorming and building together, pooling knowledge, and fleshing out issues is essential to the BI process.

Tackling complex problems is related to a concept you might already be familiar with if you completed the Google Data Analytics Certificate: structured thinking. Structured thinking is the process of recognizing the current problem or situation, organizing available information, revealing gaps and opportunities, and identifying the options. Basically, structured thinking allows you to break a problem down into manageable pieces.

The same is true for BI. Often, you have a complex problem with a lot of pieces to consider; by using a structured approach and breaking down the problem to manageable pieces, the process to solve the issue and get results is much easier. And your partners in the organization are a great resource along the way.

Now, let’s explore some examples of BI professionals collaborating with their partners to solve problems and provide insights to stakeholders that empower decision-making.

Managing membership data
The marketing team for a retail store was looking for ways to increase memberships for its loyalty program. Leaders wanted to encourage repeat customers to enroll. However, they didn’t have a system in place that allows analysts to explore both member and nonmember sales data. This requires ingesting data from a variety of systems, including the store’s online membership form and sales data. So, in addition to building a tool that moves and transforms key data, the BI team also needed to make the data from different systems align with the destination system.

In this case, they collaborated with several teams:

The marketing team: The marketing team was the primary stakeholder for this initiative. They worked with the BI team to determine project requirements, timelines, and deliverables.

The API team: Next, the BI team collaborated with the API professionals in order to integrate the data into the internal company database. The API team also helped build the reporting tools and dashboards.

Data warehousing specialists: Then they teamed up with data warehousing specialists to create a storage and organization system for the newly acquired data.

In the end, the marketing team was empowered with a system that allowed them to access the data they needed to explore customer trends and strategize ways to increase membership for their loyalty program.

Securing sensitive data
Another BI professional was working at a tech company that creates health-monitoring tools such as smart watches. The data analysts on their team were interested in exploring user data to find out how customers are using their products. Because some personally identifiable information was included, it was critical that all data be anonymized and secured.

The BI team partnered with the data warehousing specialists and data governance team in order to make sure that the storage systems protected the users while allowing data analysts to draw insights. In the end, the data analysts were able to use the smart watch data to explore trends and provide insights while still maintaining the privacy of users.  

# Business intelligence maximizes the value of data analytics
With business intelligence and data analytics gaining so much popularity these days, the term business intelligence and data analytics are often defined incorrectly, oversimplified, or used interchangeably for speedy communication. That can lead to confusion because BI and DA are quite different. In this video, we're going to sort that out. First, let's establish that both BI and DA professionals enable data-driven decision-making in their organizations. They're also both a key part of their company's data maturity. Data maturity is the extent to which an organization is able to effectively use its data in order to extract actionable insights. Whether that data includes information about your customers, staff, products, suppliers, finances, or something else, it's worthless if it can't be put to work. Putting data to work requires skilled professionals who can apply techniques and technologies to achieve high levels of maturity. In this effort, data analysts are primarily involved with using data to answer questions about what happened. On the other hand, BI professionals aim to achieve higher levels of data maturity by building data reporting tools such as dashboards. Dashboards continuously analyze and monitor data. The work isn't complete just because the tool has been created. The analysis and monitoring are ongoing this is because BI involves establishing repeatable methods to understand how things are operating and by knowing the current state, company leaders can take action to improve the future state. For example, a BI professional might investigate what new sales prospects are being targeted today. How many customers have we gained this month? Or did our weekly email perform well with new subscribers? Because BI is all about near-real-time rapid monitoring, BI insights are most effective when they make an impact right now. Therefore, the people who use the reporting tools wants to make sure they are practical and efficient. BI professionals are expert tool builders. Then it's typically the data analysts who apply these tools in order to answer a question or solve a problem by examining the data through a specific topic or lens. Again, a big part of BI is creating dashboards that provide users with clear snapshots of the current state. These tools must be impactful and easy to interpret. Even for non-technical people. If you like thinking about what you can create that meets the needs of many different users, BI will let you do just that. BI professionals generally work on large scale projects that are helpful for multiple stakeholders. Also, as you consider how you will fit in the BI world, note that BI professionals are experts in data infrastructure and enjoy the technical side of data analytics. For instance, if you love working with databases, big data, and the computer programming language SQL, BI will give you the opportunity to take your queries to the next level. If you earned the Google Data Analytics certificate, the content included there formed your foundational knowledge and experience. Now, this BI program will provide a complimentary skill set that builds on those foundations. It will also add a lot of very marketable talents to your resume that will create a compelling combination of skills for employers to consider and will open the doors for more job opportunities. In addition to the technical side of things such as managing large datasets, writing queries in SQL, and creating dashboards. You'll learn some really worthwhile professional skills. These include: the ability to juggle many different priorities, attention to detail, owning a process, communicating with others, and learning how to go beyond surface level requests. Perhaps most importantly, you'll discover the value of connecting with others to really drive results and that's how you build a career rather than just have a job. In future lessons, you will continue to explore the similarities and differences between BI and DA. The two disciplines complement and rely on each other. Just like the talented people who work in these roles. Together, they help their organizations advance on the data maturity scale every day.

# Compare data analysis and business intelligence
If you earned the Google Data Analytics Certificate or have experience working with data, you probably know that data analytics and business intelligence have both similarities and differences. In many ways, BI builds on tasks that data analysts perform. Often, data analysts are the stakeholders for whom BI professionals develop systems. In this reading, you’ll compare and contrast DA and BI to explore more about these similarities and differences.
