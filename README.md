# Welcome to the Google Business Intelligence Certificate
Our world is constantly shifting and transforming. Companies everywhere are working to lead the way to the next big thing, and consumers expect rapid, exciting product launches and packages that are delivered to their doorsteps like magic. With all of this incredible change, the value of speed has become immeasurable. It's truly one of the most important factors of business success today.

After all, the ability to identify an issue or opportunity is great, but real value is achieved when you identify that issue before it becomes a huge problem, or act upon that opportunity ahead of the competition. These days, there's more data about marketplaces, organizations, customers, competitors, and employees than ever before, but we need more than data alone to make better decisions and deliver rapid results. And that's where intelligence comes in... business intelligence. Business intelligence, or BI, involves automating processes and information channels in order to transform relevant data into actionable insights that are easily available to decision-makers. In other words, by showing decision-makers what is currently happening, organizations become more intelligent and successful.

# Google Business Intelligence Certificate overview
 In this program, you will explore the growing field of business intelligence (BI), learn how BI is crucial to organizations and the people they serve, and develop the relevant skills for a future career in the field. By completing the three courses in this certificate program, you'll prepare for entry-level positions in BI. No prior BI experience is required to complete the program, but a foundational background in data analytics is strongly encouraged.

## Google Business Intelligence Certificate courses
The Google Business Intelligence Certificate has three courses. During each course, you will complete hands-on assignments and projects based on both the day-to-day responsibilities and practical activities of a BI professional. You will learn more about a BI professional’s role in an organization and discover how to create tools and processes that empower the decision-making process. And you will create dynamic reports and dashboards that communicate near-real-time data trends.

At the end of each course, you will also have an opportunity to complete a new step in a portfolio end-of-course project that will put your new skills to work and demonstrate what you have learned to potential employers. The courses of the program are as follows:

- Foundations of Business Intelligence
- The Path to insights: Data models and pipelines
- Decisions: Dashboards and reports
